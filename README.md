This is the hub for all my templates in the F1 Tickets website. In the head of the base.html has all the required documents for the meta tags, font awesome, bootstrap CSS, google fonts used and the link to my static folder.

The navigation menu is styled to be user-friendly and incorporates Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing design. It aims to facilitate easy navigation throughout the website.

The "Sign In" and "Sign Up" options provide users with their own access to their bookings, allowing them to view and manage their reservations. Additionally, these features enable the super user to identify and track customers' bookings.

* When signed in any user will have a my orders tab in the navigation, so they can see what orders if any they have.
* I have put ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'none' so that login and registration should work without errors regardless of whether you use an email address to sign in/up.
